# Master Codes


First of all: **Feel free to help us!**


### 1 Description
This is a public repository which was created to keep the codes that will be developed during my master's project. Computational subroutines in Fortran and Python will be implemented and it will be posted on this repository. Currently, we are developing codes for magnetic anomalies for sources with regular geometry (sphere and prism). After we will work on a few codes for magnetic data processing. Some of those source codes are available in Blakely (1995).

### Source codes 
* Solid sphere:
  * Magnetic induced field and its components (**Done!**);
  * Calculated total field anomaly (**Done!**);
  * Approximated total field anomaly (**Done!**);

* Rectangular prism:
  * Total field anomaly (**Done!**);

* Potential data filtering and transforms:
  * Upward and Downward continuation (**Done!**);
  * Horizontal and vertical derivatives (**Done!**);
  * Total gradient amplitude (**Done!**);
  * Reduction filter (**Done!**);
  * Tilt angle (**Done!**);
  
* Data analysis
  * Simple cross-correlation coefficient (**In progress...**).


#### Warning!
It had better be aware that all files contained within this repository are in constant development.
